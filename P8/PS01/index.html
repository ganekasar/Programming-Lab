                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The term blockchain refers to the fact that it is a ‘chain’ of ‘blocks’. A ‘chain’ because everything is recorded in chronological order. And ‘blocks’ because the transactions are added to the chain in groups rather than individually.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">‘Block’</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Each block records a number of transactions, similar to a page in a record-keeping book. The amount of transactions on a block varies from blockchain to blockchain. For example, each block on the Bitcoin blockchain holds up to 1 megabyte of information.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">‘Chain’</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">These transactions are recorded in the form of hashes — strings of numbers and letters. The hash of each transaction is generated to include information from the current and past transactions. This creates a chain effect where the order of hashes cannot be changed. As a result, transactions are immutable once they’ve been added. <br>
                    All transactions need to be verified before they are added onto the blockchain. This is done through a consensus mechanism, which allows all the nodes on the network to agree on things without an authority. This is how blockchains stay autonomous and decentralized.</p>
